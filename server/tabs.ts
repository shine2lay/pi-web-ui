/**
 * tabs — choose what an instance offers.
 *
 * pi-web-ui shows Chat, Terminal, Git, Search, Background tasks and Settings,
 * always, plus a tab per installed plugin. On the machine you are working on
 * that is the point of the tool. Exposed to other people it is not: Terminal
 * opens a shell as the server's user, and Git shows the working copy with
 * commit and diff a click away. Today there is no way to leave those out.
 *
 * `PI_WEB_TABS=chat,search,settings` is that way. Absent — the default —
 * means every tab, so nothing changes for anybody who does not set it.
 *
 * The rule that shapes the whole thing: **a hidden tab whose messages the
 * server still accepts is a hidden tab, not a disabled one.** Anything that
 * can open the WebSocket can send `terminal_create`. So the client stops
 * drawing them and the server stops answering them, and the second half is the
 * one that matters.
 *
 * Chat is never off: it is the application.

 * `run_command` is listed under terminal because it starts a process in one:
